# **App Name**: Bingo Bonanza

## Core Features:

- Bingo Card Generation: Display a 5x5 bingo card with randomized words/phrases from a predefined pool.
- Square Selection and Flipping: Allow players to select squares, which then flip to reveal a pastel color while retaining the text.
- Game Mode Selection: Provide a choice of four Bingo game modes: Classic, Blackout, Corners, Rows + Columns.
- Multiplayer Synchronization: Handle real-time synchronization for bingo word sets, win detection, and push notifications to all users upon a player winning the Bingo round.
- AI-Powered Content Filtering: An AI tool determines how well a group of seed phrases/words fit into different thematic areas. Only high-relevance phrases should be allowed to form the bingo 'root'.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pale Lavender (#D8B2D1) to evoke a sense of calm and focus.
- Background color: Very light grayish-blue (#F0F8FF) to minimize distraction and ensure readability.
- Accent color: Soft Coral (#F08080) to highlight interactive elements (like 'start game') without being too jarring.
- Clear, readable font optimized for a digital display. Medium font weight and good contrast with background elements.
- Clean and minimalist layout. Prioritize the 5x5 grid as the central focus of the UI, so it is easily readable.
- Subtle transitions when squares are selected to provide a tactile response and to also offer feedback.
